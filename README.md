# Discord Facebook video previewer bot

This is my first project using Rust, primarily for learning purposes. The project is a Discord bot that helps users preview videos from Facebook by simply fetching video url from snapvideo.io and sending it directly to a Discord channel.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the code might not be clean as this project is a learning endeavor.
